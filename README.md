Just Another 2D Game Engine (for lack of a better name)
=======================================================

What Makes It Better Than Other Engines?
----------------------------------------
Currently there is no reason to pick my engine over any other 2D engine. Perhaps mine is more bare-bone and you like that. But ultimately this project was made as a way of learning and for my own future endeavors.

How Complete Is This Engine?
----------------------------
Currently it's not much. Once the mapping class is done though, it should be ready for any other indie developer to take the engine and use it for their own game.

Can I Use This In My Commercial game?
-------------------------------------
Yes, please remember that you must keep the license file bundled with your source code though. Also please be kind and give credit to me for developing the engine.

What Systems Does It Support?
-----------------------------
Currently Windows, but Mac OS X is planned.
